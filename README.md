Code in solovay_kitaev.ipynb -- gate synthesis is still a little bit buggy

Examples are there for Clifford + T synthesis 

It takes a long time to generate an e-net even for a small max depth (4-5) because the algorithm I use is basically brute force, so I've also included a pickle file of around 8000 words generated by clifford + T gateset that can be imported
